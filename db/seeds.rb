content: "<p></p><p>On October 1st, Catalonia held a referendum to separate from Spanish rule. Stories of independence always interest me as I become convinced national identity is being challenged around the globe. The Blockchain will further fuel this trend as bottom-up and decentralized markets, currencies, and governing systems start dominating decision making and offer alternatives to traditional matters of the centralized state. Sub-national governance, specifically city governments, will benefit most from the new levels of organization the Blockchain provides. City governments are where the rubber meets the road. Local government directly touches its citizens — through police, roads, schools, etc. Cities are where policy and action have to take place in order for society to function.</p><p>At the Pentagon, I belonged to a small group of fringe thinkers. An old cantankerous bunch of defense analysts that saw the world through a lens of cause-effect and counter-effect. To this group, outcomes are always mixed and a result of forecast-able actions of living systems. One of the propionate themes of the group’s discussions was power. How organizations create power, manage power, share power, project power, and even lose power. One of the old&nbsp;<em>isms</em>&nbsp;my elders taught me:&nbsp;<em>“regimes always bring themselves down.”&nbsp;</em>Throughout my career this idea seemed to be proven over and over as national governments across the Middle East and North Africa imploded.</p><p><br></p><p>So, when Madrid started flexing military and police might at the Catalonian movement for independence, my first thought was, here we go, I get to witness the birth of a new European nation!! Then on the October 5th, Madrid threw a haymaker punch and pulled the banks and large corporations out Catalonia’s capital Barcelona. The wind in my revolutionary sails quickly fell calm and disappointed.</p><p>Catalonia’s ruling elite quickly changing their tune from independence to compromise and started fleeing to Brussels. Madrid’s financial move was an attack on one of the independence movement’s centers-of-gravity, finances. The difference between what Catalonia pays to the central government and what it receives is over €10 billion Euros. Madrid brandishing a knife at the purse strings of Barcelona is a powerful gesture to show centralized control.</p><p><br></p><p>The Blockchain has an obvious and powerful role in self-rule in Catalonia, with economic tools like cryptocurrencies that can protect against nodes of failure like centralized banks. However, beyond side-stepping traditional financial infrastructure, Catalonia could embrace Blockchain governance and prove it can out-govern Madrid.</p><p>Governments are made of people and appealing to those government functionaries to agree to allow computer-aided processes that are encoded with the laws of the land won’t be difficult. Justice, transparency and equal protection under the law become much more attainable on a Blockchain governing system.</p><p>The people within government are quick to point technologies-of-accountability at the people. The Blockchain provides an opportunity for political parties to aim the gun of transparency on themselves and ensure the people are best served by the technology and tools available.</p><p><br></p><h3>What would Blockchain governance look like?</h3><p>• Putting government budgets on a blockchain and coding that blockchain with the agreed upon budgetary plan as the guiding computer-aided rules or Smart Contracts will ensure proper handling and oversight of public funds.</p><p>• Legislation created on a blockchain can send out text messages every time the draft of that legislation is altered.</p><p>• Blockchain email systems will maintain permeate records of government functions. Shouldn’t our leaders and institutions act as if someone is watching and reading?</p><p>• Blockchain administered utility systems, like wastewater management, city busses, power grids and such will run more efficiently and with less vulnerability to pilfer.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Local is the new black</h3><p>Embracing radical transparency in localized governance the Blockchain offers will dominate the market of the public affection, good administration and political legitimacy and power.</p><p>Catalonian markets should make major moves in Blockchain technology to secure the financial vulnerability Madrid just exposed. And further, political parties in Catalonia should adopt the Blockchain and start building their case to the people and outside neighbors that transparent localized rule is in everyone’s interest.</p><p></p>",

  summary: "As it is with Estonian weather there are only few days of sunshine in the autumn, mostly it’s rain and clouds. Fortunately there was just a single day during a weekend where it was promising sunshine, so we didn’t waste any time and continued our discovery trip from where we left off last time.",
content: "<p></p><p><em>Friend of mine was complaining that my articles have become really depressing lately because all I share are those gloomy black and white photos. Now winter is really coming here and the colourful leaves are just a memory from not so distant past. So it’s just the right time to share some colour as well.</em></p><p><br></p><p>As it is with Estonian weather there are only few days of sunshine in the autumn, mostly it’s rain and clouds. Fortunately there was just a single day during a weekend where it was promising sunshine, so we didn’t waste any time and continued our discovery trip from where we left off last time.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>This time I had loaded my camera with some colour film. Just because I did finally want to capture some of those elusive autumn leaves and to be honest I was missing a bit of colour lately.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>So the first stop was the Pärispea Military base which we explored last time. Back then we arrived fairly late at night so it was all dark and gloomy and honestly, quite scary. This time we got there in the middle of the day, it was nice and sunny, so we got a totally different feelings from the place.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>Instead of scary it felt rather warm and cozy instead. Not sure what it is with the sunlight glowing through board cracks, but they are somehow relaxing.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>Took me a while to figure out how those dots on the wall formed. But they are just pieces of broken glass on the floor which reflect the sunlight to the wall.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>So the whole military base is next to the sea. There are pretty nice views coming from those windows. But as the beach was fairly close, we didn’t stop there are checked it out first hand.</span></p><p><br></p><p>We were bit disappointed to learn this part of the base does not extend very far. Although there are some more buildings nearby, not all of them are exactly abandoned and not really well preserved either, so we carried on to see what else we can find.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a place called Pärispea Fish Farm. It dates back to soviet times as it was part of the “Kirov Kolkhoz”, built in 1979. It was designed to farm trout using seawater pumped directly from the sea into the special ponds.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently it still operated fairly recently, but right now, it looked liked the pond and water supply channels had dried up. It did seem all but abandoned, and there were “for sale posters”. We still didn’t skulk around for too long and carried on.</p><p><br></p><p>I later checked the ads from real-estate sites. Found some, which claim that it is very possible to restore the whole factory to full functionality. Will this happen or will it become another abandoned landmark, only time will tell.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>As we had been running around for some hours already, we visited Viinistu because the maps was showing it had a restaurant and we were all hungry.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>It did have restaurant and it had really delicious food and the prices were fairly good as well for the quality. The girl who serviced us was a bit confused how to organize the courses and the bill she gave us was even more confused as her. She definitely has lot of confusion in her life. But everything worked out great and the bill also added up correctly regardless of not exactly containing what we ordered, so we carried on.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The sun was getting fairly low already, and the golden rays of the autumn sun were lighting the trees. Views were absolutely gorgeous, so we stopped here and there, to get some shots.</p><p><br></p><p>When you really want to get good picture of autumn leaves in the absolute perfect light, you should look places with some best place to stop is probably place where you have plenty of maples, oaks and other colourful leafy trees, so we made our first stop in a pine forest.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>So after taking pictures of pines and sea, and rocks and all other non-autumn related things. I finally got two crappy pictures of the autumn leaves too. Here they are. Enjoy.</span></p><p><br></p><p>Then we spent couple of hours searching for an abandoned rocket base only to find the territory was taken over by a company called “Baltic Spoon”. You would imagine old rocket silos are best places for manufacturing spoons, but turns out they don’t actually make spoons but veneer instead.</p><p><br></p><p>But the light was gone, and we left the veneer manufacturing alone for the time being and headed home.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Now by the time I publish this article, the last leaves have fallen off and whole Estonia is covered with just gray melting snow muck. I installed indescribable amount of colourful leds in my studio, just so I wouldn’t forget what colour looks like.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>As I am not only gonna take pictures of my studio, expect to get more depressing black and white photography from me in the future, unless of course I travel somewhere, which I totally will.

title: "The Story of a Collaborative Referendum",
subtitle: "How an incredible organisation of volunteers and professionals made the Catalan referendum possible.",
summary: "Today, you can barely understand what’s really going on in Catalonia. Endless Twitter feeds and Facebook posts are quickly colonized by people rushing to express their sentiments from both sides of the conflict.",
content: "<p></p><p>Today, you can barely understand what’s really going on in Catalonia. Endless Twitter feeds and Facebook posts are quickly colonized by people rushing to express their sentiments from both sides of the conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>However, everybody that was part of the Catalan independence referendum will agree that the main reason it was still possible — even after being banned by the Spanish government — was an incredibly well-organized network of volunteers and professionals. These people came from many walks of life, including IT technicians, school principals, politicians, international supporters, and even farmers. People united by the belief that a ban from the constitutional court was not a legitimate way to stop millions of people’s right to vote.</p><p><br></p><h3>Top-to-bottom organisation</h3><p>Organization at multiple levels, performed several days in advance, was absolutely key to making sure the referendum went ahead. After the Spanish government’s first measures to stop the referendum, the first thing the Catalan government did was to backup every single thing needed to perform it. The Catalan government quickly realized that it should not reveal all the information that the citizens were expecting to get on a normal referendum. This was privileged information that the Spanish government would use to stop communication between organizers and citizens.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>Then the detention of Catalan government representatives came. This was the spark that burned the fire for some citizens. As soon as the first confiscation of 9 million official ballots happened, professional printing companies quickly created an association to repeat the printing multiple times over from several locations in Catalonia. They even uploaded the ballot template as a printable&nbsp;.pdf document.</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p><em>This was one of the first collective initiatives that gave momentum to the several that came afterwards</em>. It was also the right moment to send a message of consistency and synchronization to the community that wanted to make this referendum to happen. Whatsapp was the main tool to inform about what to do and what not. Here you have some of the messages I received and everybody followed:</p><ul><li><em>Don’t try to vote with a ballot printed at home, it won’t be valid. (The Catalan president published a video on his Twitter where industrial printers were shown printing around 5 ballots per second just 3 days before the referendum, and after more than 15 million ballots in total were already confiscated)</em></li><li><em>Don’t wear or carry independence flags or any kind of flags the day of the voting. International observers will evaluate this as a biased referendum on their reports.</em></li><li><em>Passive resistance is the number one principle.</em></li></ul><p><br></p><p>The Spanish government announced that it will prosecute school principals, holding them on account of secession, if they try to open schools and use them as polling stations. The reaction of the principals was interesting: they delivered the keys of the schools to the Catalan government to avoid being detained by the authorities. The education community opened a website to call for volunteers to open schools. Although the site was quickly closed down, I registered and begun receiving information to my email and a Telegram group.</p><p><br></p><p>The Spanish government went one step further, declaring that any mayor who had permitted voting in their cities and villages will be taken to court. This was unprecedented. But because justice is slow and the number of pro-referendum mayors sat at around 700, massive detentions were almost impracticable in the short run.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>By this time, Spanish police were able not only to close down all the referendum-related websites hosted in Spain (both from official sources and volunteering mirroring), but also to block access to more than 140 URLs from any IP located in Spain throughout the national internet providers. Also students from several universities installed booths on the street with their laptops to help elderly people to check the assigned voting place for them.</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Finally, the Catalan information technology and telecommunications center was visited by the Spanish Civil Guard. At this point, polling statistics and vote counting procedures were seriously compromised. Website mirrors had to be transferred to Github static sites set up by volunteers once again. Remarkably, non-tech savvy citizens learned for the first time how to use a proxy to access those sites. Julian Assange and other international supporters educated people on how to circumvent the censorship and monitoring coming from the IT department of the Spanish Civil Guard through VPNs, Tor, peer-to-peer private chat apps and other hi-tech telecommunication methods.</p><p><br></p><h3>The countdown to 1-O</h3><p>The day before 1-O (October 1st) arrived. Everybody knew that in order to give the referendum its best chance, measures taken in the digital world had to be accompanied by real world measures (some of which were inspired by the civil war era, when people escaped and hid from Franco’s regime):</p><p>Firstly, as official transparent ballot boxes has been confiscated several times, the last resort was to buy plastic boxes. Officially presented just a couple days before the referendum, these looked cheap but were incredibly practical for the exceptional situation. Durable, light, stackable, and with 3 strong zip ties, they were stored temporarily in a small French town until volunteers were given the order to disseminate the boxes using private cars and vans all over Catalonia.</p><p><br></p><p>The couriers only had partial information about the delivery route, so we are talking about encryption methods taken to a real world scenario here. If some carriers were caught the rest would continue to deliver the ballot boxes pretty much the same way. You can understand partial segments of an encrypted message, but the whole string is totally meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Then, the volunteers that offered to open schools and other polling places were told to organize leisure activities for more than 24 hours non-stop, making sure food and drink amenities were available, as local police said that they would appear in some places at 6pm Friday, 2 days before the referendum. We decided to finish the activities on Saturday night, the day before the referendum, closing ourselves inside the schools and polling places. Only one person had the keys, but nobody knew who it was.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>More professional associations like firefighters joined the cause to protect voters. Farmers offered their tractors to block entrances, and even the day after the referendum, lots of attorneys volunteered to defend people against the multiple human rights violations that were carried out by the police.</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>It was a tough day though for the local police, Civil Guard and Spanish police. They had to choose between clashing with voters or disobeying the Spanish constitutional court. The reason why the international press were showing the clash is because the local police of Mossos d’Esquadra chose to not beat the voters, while most police did the opposite. At the end of the day, local police of Mossos d’Esquadra were accused of secessionism and of disobeying orders from the constitutional court — despite being the force that managed to close more polling places than any other police force without beating voters: 40.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsapp was an unbearable place. It was full of fake news, with some unionists trolling organizers by hacking their groups’ names and sending threatening messages. By Saturday night we had switched to Telegram.</p><p><br></p><h3>A symphony of masterful planning</h3><p>In the early morning of October 1st, we waited for many hours outside in front of the doors of polling stations to protect them from police confiscation. Before the afternoon, people started to receive horrific images through social media, as well as some fake messages. One of them told us that 50 police vans were approaching our town to try to get an advance surrender. This never came. After being treated by paramedics, people who were beaten up came back to vote in alternate polling stations if their own was closed by the police.</p><p><br></p><p>James Bond-worthy distraction maneuvers included the Catalan president’s announcement of the town in which he was planning to vote. Even the organizers loudly told everybody that he had already voted, even though he had never been there. Instead, he travelled in a procession of several cars. The procession stopped beneath a bridge while the Catalan president switched from his own car to another one in order to confuse the helicopter that was chasing him.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>Everything was planned like in a philarmonic orchestra. Everyone knew what to do and nobody knew what the others would do. Although one thing was slightly different. The director of the orchestra was not a politician, or one single person — the director of the orchestra was the entire community of voters.</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Puigdemont appeared on television announcing that the Spanish government had defeated almost everything the Catalan government had done to achieve a normal referendum. He then said that if the population of Catalonia still wanted the referendum to take place they had to get involved and collaborate in every way they could. So we did!</p><p><br></p><p></p>",

title: "A Forgotten Greece: The Pomakochoria",
subtitle: "In Greece, a village without Greeks",
summary: "In a backwater region of northeastern Greece lies a group of indigenous Muslim villages. Despite their isolation and differences with the rest of Greece, they have kept their language and culture intact.",
content: "<p></p><p>After miles of mountainous backroads north of the city of Xanthi, Greece lies a region that is commonly unmentioned when discussing modern day Greece. Far from the highly-photographed, whitewashed villages of the Greek Islands frequently featured in touristic brochures are the villages of Thrace known as the “Pomakochoria”, home to indigenous Turko-Slavic speaking Muslims.</p><p><br></p><p>Their diverse and complex identity is a result of the many empires and governments that ruled over this hidden region. When the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) exempted Muslims of this region from population exchanges between Turkey and Greece as an effort to homogenize both nations, this created a natural isolation for decades to come. After getting to know several locals from the village of Echinos, I was able to learn more about this community of Greece that many never hear about.</p><p><br></p><h4>Identity</h4><p>Imagine encountering a village of around 3,000 people that hold Greek citizenship, speak 3 languages (Turkish, Pomak, and Greek), practice Islam, and feel somewhat alienated from the rest of the Greek Orthodox majority of Greece. Prior to our arrival to Echinos, I was expecting to encounter a community that had a clear identity or an affinity to a certain culture, language, or people group. I was quite wrong. Although their daily lives demand Pomak and Greek to be spoken outside of the home, the overwhelming majority of the population of Echinos speaks Turkish at home.</p><p><br></p><p>We were able to meet locals through the local&nbsp;<em>kaffenion&nbsp;</em>(Ottoman-style coffeehouse), where many of the older generation men spend their days sipping coffee, smoking cigarettes, and solving the world’s problems. What we concluded is that many of the locals in Echinos and in surrounding villages of the Pomakochoria claim Turkish roots, but are also somewhat pressured to claim a Turkish identity due to political reasons. They also did feel like they were Greeks as well because of their geographical location and citizenship, but ultimately we felt that they claimed a Turkish identity. On top of that, there is the odd retention of the Pomak language within the community, which has no written tradition, but has been passed down orally from generation to generation.</p><p><br></p><h4>Support from the Greek government</h4><p>Even though we were in an EU country, I still had my reservations on whether or not the locals would feel like they could share the opinions openly, especially with us being outsiders. Our advantage, though, was that we were of Greek origin and could communicate in a language that they were fluent in, avoiding any language barrier. The overall consensus was that things are much better than what they used to be. After peeling back the layers, we learned that prior to 1996, outsiders were forbidden from visiting the Pomakochoria region, consequently isolating this community. They were also not allowed to leave the region without gaining permission from Greek police. Whether or not this was true, the locals conveyed that their situation has improved tremendously since then, even though things could still be better. When it comes to the essentials, the educational and medical needs of the community are being met by the Greek government. On the other end of the spectrum, I learned that the Turkish government does not play a role in the daily lives of the community, but if anyone from the Turkish-Pomak community wants to travel or gain residency there, it can be done with ease.</p><p><br></p><h4>Local economy</h4><p>An industrious community, Echinos has approximately 2,000 of its residents living and working in Germany. It seems that this has sustained the village and region the last couple of decades and protected it from external factors (isolation, economic crisis, urbanization, etc.). Unlike most of Greece, where the lifeblood of the economy is in crisis, Echinos enjoys a quiet prosperity due to family members sending money over from Germany. Interestingly enough, the villagers living in Germany own over 20 businesses there that specialize in repairing ships.</p><p><br></p><p>We met a local retired teacher, Ibrahim Sali, who was very inviting and warm, and loved giving us insight on the village’s history, culture, language. He even was willing to share some local gossip. He had his own take on how the majority of the community’s young men are away in Germany leaving behind their wives and families.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“The local women slaughter (metaphor) their husbands who are away in Germany. The men work in Germany, so the money here comes from Germany. Because the men are gone, you’ll see the women here spend their money on expensive clothes and shoes from Xanthi (nearby city) as a way to cope.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><h4>Local traditions and culture</h4><p>Like the rest of the villages in the Pomakochoria region, Echinos is overwhelmingly Muslim and quite conservative from the outside looking in. Traditional islamic customs and traditions are observed by the village, such as: strict observance of Ramadan and fasting (locally called&nbsp;<em>Ramazan</em>), the halal diet, and conservative dress amongst the women. Although Islam forbids drinking alcohol, Ibrahim mentioned that it is common for locals to privately drink in their homes. When we asked Ibrahim about the character and culture of the locals, we were surprised with his response. “When the villagers leave their village, they act completely different and more mafioso.”</p><p><br></p><p>What’s more is that as we drove around and walked through the village, we noticed that there was no&nbsp;<em>plateia&nbsp;</em>or main plaza. This is always found in a Greek village as the epicenter of community and social life where one can find cafés, restaurants, and businesses. Instead we found that the village had a couple of&nbsp;<em>kaffenions</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>bougatsa</em>&nbsp;shops scattered throughout, but no plaza or social epicenter. This showed us that the community was more reserved and quiet in comparison to villages populated by ethnic Greeks.</p><p><br></p><h4>The Pomak language</h4><p>Although Pomak, known in Greek as&nbsp;<em>Pomakika</em>, is not the language spoken at home in Echinos, we were able to have Ibrahim provide a small list of words in Greek and English translated into Pomak. Many of the words are slavic in origin, but there also words that come from Greek or Turkish.</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Brother = Brat</li><li>Sister = Séstra</li><li>Mother = Maika</li><li>Father = Ubaïka</li><li>Goodbye = Mérhaba</li><li>Thank you = Saöl</li><li>Home = Kósha</li><li>School = Mektép</li><li>Store = Dükén</li><li>Friend = Arkadásh</li><li>Table = Masa</li><li>Fruit = Yemish</li><li>Meat = Miyoso</li><li>Cheese = Sirinyé</li><li>Church = Kiürsé</li><li>Mosque = Joumayié</li><li>Water = Vodá</li><li>Watch (wristwatch) = Saat</li><li>Food = Yemék</li><li>Car = Kúrsa</li><li>Stairs = Skála</li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>",

title: "Running out of steam",
subtitle: "Between Britain & Europe",
summary: "Michel Barnier’s decision to meet with a trio of elite Remainers today is ill-advised and the latest in a series of affronts directed at the British government...",
content: "<p></p><p>As Britain tumbles out of Europe, it is sadly fitting that an enterprise we once helped to prop up should also be disappearing over the horizon.</p><p><br></p><p>In a scrupulously detailed elegy to a once revolutionary mode of transport that has fallen prey to the age of convenience, journalist and railway anorak Andrew Martin reluctantly rang the death knell for the European sleeper train earlier this year.</p><p><em>Night Train: The Rise and Fall of the Sleeper</em>&nbsp;sees its monolingual author ride what is left of the continent’s depleted sleeper network either side of the Brexit vote. In the process, he is exposed to the enduringly telegenic dangers and fading delights associated with closing your eyes in one country and waking up in another.</p><p><br></p><p>But the long goodbye of the night train is no fringe event, nor is the despondency it engenders the exclusive reserve of eccentric loners clutching dog-eared railway timetables. As one of the sleeper’s many patrons, I will not be alone in lamenting the passing of a European institution quite literally freighted with a heady mix of stout tradition and intoxicating uncertainty.</p><p>Now for a confession: my first, and presumably last, dalliance with a bona fide sleeper was over two years ago. Little did we know it at the time, but when my friend and I stepped through the gathering dusk of the Vienna station platform onto a train bound for Venice, we were almost certainly joining a service from Paris dating back to the late nineteenth century. What appeared to our island imaginations a feat tantamount to teleportation was merely the last heave of a twilight swing across Western Europe; we were just two more wide-eyed Interrailers thumbing a lift.</p><p><br></p><p>In a last-minute impulse of parsimony, I had insisted we swap the bed in the private berth we had booked for a bog-standard seat in a public compartment, albeit one with exceptionally roomy luggage racks. However, my momentary pride at having resisted the siren call of luxury in favour of more spartan living quarters was soon erased by the sight of my friend uncomfortably spread-eagled across the bench opposite in a valiant bid for sleep. Dawn eventually broke over the causeway connecting Venice with the Italian mainland, assailing my bloodshot eyes with piercing sunlight as we coaxed our aching limbs onto the forecourt of Santa Lucia station at the water’s edge. The gondolas plying back and forth on the Grand Canal thrummed with a momentarily alien vigour.</p><p><br></p><p>No thanks to me, we hadn’t done it right. Wagons-lits, once so much in common parlance among the British travelling classes that you could be forgiven for not recognising it as a French word denoting a Belgian railway company, were supposed to replicate home comforts. In fact, they often went further, not least within the tinkling confines of the fabled dining car. The status of France as the continent’s gastronomic benchmark before which the rest of us instinctively genuflect must owe much to the haute-cuisine on offer at these mobile restaurants, where the introduction of three-course menus between the wars was seen as a regrettable economy.</p><p><br></p><p>Just shy of two years after my Venetian expedition, I was standing on a sand dune somewhere in the middle of the North Sea island of Sylt in the torrential rain. My head full of romantic visions of sunset crossings, I had elected to take the train from Hamburg straight after work. It being February, I had instead arrived in the pitch black and I was struggling to pick out my hostel through the maritime murk. Officially, I was there for a solitary 24-hour running escape, but my disappointment when darkness fell before we had even reached Husum, North Sea poet Theodor Sturm’s ‘grey town by the sea’ in northernmost Schleswig-Holstein, told me my anticipation had been as much about the journey as the destination.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, the trip had delivered on the other promise of long-haul train journeys: fleeting kinship with complete strangers. These stolen encounters thrive on the liberating contrast they present to the stiff exchanges that pass for everyday conversation. Caught like us in a world apart, our fellow passengers have a knack for casting off the formal shackles of polite society and confiding in their neighbours before duty reasserts itself at the end of the line. My lot that night was to be corralled into an amiably one-sided heart-to-heart with a disarmingly sociable Bulgarian who flattened the language barrier between us with the sheer force of his desire to be understood. Via a combination of his urgent hand gestures and percussive repetition of a limited stock of German and English nouns, I learned that he hoped to settle permanently in Germany with his fluent wife and their child. He was a waiter in Westerland, the island capital to which he commuted every morning across the Hindenburgdamm I would later traverse myself.</p><p><br></p><p>On an eight-hour train ride from Lille to Barcelona three years earlier, it had first dawned on me that neglecting to talk to your travelling companions would actually be considered rude. A far cry from the tacit omertà in force on the London Underground, a silent European train carriage is a disconcerting anomaly. It is also a wasted opportunity. Having restricted myself for the first half of that French odyssey to the forbidding company of novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans and an obscenely large baguette, I succumbed to the benign overtures of a retired Parisian man as the flat northern plains gave way to the Alps. Having grown tired of the relentless pace of the city his compatriots know simply as&nbsp;<em>le monde</em>, he had withdrawn with his pension to the Mediterranean backwater of Sète, a town best known for its annual water jousting tournament. By the time he alighted, we were firmly in Pyrenean territory. His last act had been to point out a flock of pink flamingos clustering around a watering hole in the distance, the last of the summer sun glinting off their wing feathers.</p><p><br></p><p>Alone again, I could contemplate what is arguably the European Union’s supreme achievement. The whimsical pensioner’s replacement, a soldier home on leave from a peacekeeping assignment in Mali, had got out at Perpignan, leaving me to cross the Spanish border in splendid isolation. Once upon a time, this transition would have been encumbered with border checks by mistrustful officials with an inveterate suspicion of lone riders. Indeed, of all the blows inflicted on the European project over the past couple of years, the blithe violation of the Schengen agreement implied by the return of armed border patrols to Austria and Hungary has been among the bitterest pills to swallow.</p><p><br></p><p>After all, the humble train is still the most natural means of exploration. Unlike the whiff of invasion that clings to any arrival by plane, entering another country by rail is automatically more conciliatory than hurrying from an aircraft into a shuttle bus designed to whisk you straight to some gated hotel complex. Trains also go further faster than the ever expanding fleet of FlixBus coaches currently undercutting its more storied rival with prices as eye-catching as its carbon footprint. The suspense attendant upon waking to a dramatically altered landscape only glimpsed in outline as darkness fell, mingled with disbelief at the abrupt nature of your displacement, creates a thrill of disorientation that for some is more than half the point of going away in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>Or it did. The same friend who had made the best of it on the sleeper to Venice was also an occasional passenger on the night train from Paris to Munich, where we were both studying at the time. While reading&nbsp;<em>Night Train</em>, I discovered with a jolt that it had outlived his custom by mere months. For those of us whose hopes and dreams have Europe at their heart, time may be running out in more ways than one.</p><p></p>",

His basic stand point is simple: we all face the same challenges, namely global warming, the digital transition, immigration and terrorism. To overcome them, a nation folded back on itself can’t do much. Macron acknowledged that today’s Europe is too weak either, but he believes that a collaborative work on it can help it become the solution against all odds.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“So, rather than concentrating all of our energy in our internal divisions […] rather than loosing our debates in a European civil war […] we need to think about how to consider making a strong Europe, in today’s&nbsp;world.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>The President set 6 pillars for a Europe 2.0, here’s an exhaustive but yet complete list of his plans.</p><p><br></p><h3>Safety</h3><p>In this pillar, the French president asks for an improved cohesion among European countries in our efforts in Defense and Intelligence. His propositions include:</p><ul><li>A European action capacity autonomous from OTAN, and a European defense fund.</li><li>A common strategic culture and a common intervention force. That would imply to welcome soldiers coming from every European voluntary country in each national army. Those would be not only ground soldiers but also management soldiers involved in planification and intelligence. France would start first as an example. Above all, E. Macron asked for a common doctrine to intervene.</li><li>Creation of a European Parquet Office Against Organized Criminality and Terrorism to face terrorism together.</li><li>A European Intelligence Academy, committed to the formation of European agents. It would be a place of exchange to benefit from the best knowledge of each nation’s intelligence culture.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Immigration</h3><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“As long as we will leave some of our partners overwhelmed by massive arrivals, without helping them to manage their borders, as long as our procedures will remain slow and disparate, as long as we will be unable to organize together the return of the migrants who don’t have the right ro asylum, we will lack both efficiency and humanity.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>The reference here goes to Italy and the situation which led its Prime Minister to threaten to close the country’s ports to foreign boats in July:</p><p><a href='https://nationall.eu/italy-threatened-to-close-its-ports-to-foreign-ships-carrying-rescued-refugees-6fbae079e3b1' target='_blank' style='background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); color: inherit;'>Italy threatened to close its ports to foreign ships carrying rescued refugees</a></p><p><a href='https://nationall.eu/italy-threatened-to-close-its-ports-to-foreign-ships-carrying-rescued-refugees-6fbae079e3b1' target='_blank' style='background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); color: inherit;'>The country asks for support to manage the influx of migrants</a></p><p><br></p><p>Even though the number of immigrants coming through Libya shrank drastically following Libya’s increased coast control in August, the immigrant crisis is far from being resolved.</p><p><a href='https://nationall.eu/the-number-of-illegal-refugees-crossing-mediterranea-from-lybia-shrank-drastically-9d1da36832da' target='_blank' style='background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); color: inherit;'>The number of illegal refugees crossing Mediterranea from Lybia shrank drastically</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href='https://nationall.eu/the-number-of-illegal-refugees-crossing-mediterranea-from-lybia-shrank-drastically-9d1da36832da' target='_blank' style='background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); color: inherit;'>But we’re not sure about the effects it will foster</a></p><p>Macron’s propositions for a common resolution program are focused on the construction of a common area of borders, asylum and immigration:</p><ul><li>Creation of a European Office for Asylum, which would accelerate and uniformise the procedures through a common computer system. This system would avoid to have asylum seekers sending one request to each countries and therefore having 30 countries processing the same request.</li><li>Creation of a European border police responsible for managing borders and ensure the return who are not eligible for asylum.</li><li>Funding an integration program for those who owned the asylum right.</li><li>Stabilization of the countries of origin thanks to a common policy. Closer relationships between Europe and Africa to make it a leading ally. The instrument of this policy would be the rise of the development aid. This instrument would be financed by the revival of the European financial transactions tax project: Macron proposes that every countries adopt the UK tax as a standard.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Climate</h3><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“Do we want to continue producing as ever before and defend a competitiveness in front of power which are currently making that choice or already made it, or do we wish to accelerate and become leaders of a new productive model which wont only be an economic model but also a model of society, of civilization which will allow to rethink inequalities, the externalities of a society in which the main victimes of the imbalances are the weakest and the most fragile?”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>As we can understand the goal is not simply to reset our economic system to make it environmentally friendly, but to put climate at the core of our society for everyone to live accordingly with the environment. That involves:</p><ul><li>To finally set a substantial and unique price to carbon, around 25 to 30€ per ton.</li><li>After a fine territorial analysis, accompanying sectors in which the producing model of the past is leading to avoid them to collapse after the higher carbon price introduction.</li><li>A common European energy market which promotes interconnections. That is to say, to allow the whole area to benefit from the renewable energy produced in every country, but also from the nuclear energy produced when it’s required. According to Macron, those interconnections are blocked today.</li><li>Introduction of a carbon tax at Europe’s borders to prevent European global companies from being disabled against competitors located in less demanding areas.</li><li>Set up of a European industrial program aimed to support the clean automotive industry and the deployment of common related infrastructures.</li><li>Reviewing the Common Agricultural Policy to make it protect farmers against hazards and the market fluctuations. The review purpose would also to assure the european agricultural transition and to give more flexibility to countries to organize their territories and sectors at a regional level.</li><li>Creation of a European Force of Investigation and Control to ensure food safety and quality standards throughout Europe.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Digital transition &amp; economics</h3><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“The digital transformation, it’s not an activity area, it’s not a contemporary anecdote and Europe has a lot to lose as well as to win in it. Europe has this unique attachement to the permanent equilibrium between liberty, solidarity and safety, and that’s what’s at stake in the digital revolution.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p><a href='https://www.marshall.usc.edu/sites/default/files/Unicorn-Index-Report-GT17.pdf' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>Europe is far to be the region of the highest share of Unicorn companies</a>. Macron wishes Europe to take the lead on the digital revolution thanks to radical innovation. He also wants a strong Euro and a bigger common budget to diminish the divergences.</p><ul><li>In the 2 following years, creation of a European Agency for Breakthrough Innovation with the example of the DARPA in the US during the Space Conquest momentum.</li><li>Creation of a Digital Single Market to allow a common regulation and to elaborate together a compensation mechanism against the old economy’s losses.</li><li>Taxation of the created value where it is produced. Usually, tech companies are taxed after charges. Therefore, they place the head quarters in a low tax place which charge every subsidiaries. This way, you can’t tax subsidiaries because they earn nothing after being charged, and the whole earnings are being taxed in the head quarters at a lower rate. The taxation of the created value where it is produced avoids it.</li><li>Because countries cannot face a crisis alone if they don’t control their currency, Macron, who says to be very attached to the Euro, proposes a stronger budget inside the Euro Zone driven by a common minister for 2020. Those spendings could be financed by the digital and environmental taxes. That wouldn’t work without unity.</li><li>Uniformisation of the corporation tax before 2020.</li><li>Creation of a European social model in respect of every countries’ differences but also a roadmap for a convergence, starting in november 2017.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Unity</h3><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“And culture and knowledge will always remain the strongest cement of the Union. Because this Europe where each European acknowledges his destiny in a Greek temple profile or Mona Lisa’s smile, who was able to know the emotions throughout the whole Europe while reading Musil or Proust, this Europe of the cafes which Steiner talks about, this Europe of which Suares said that it’s “a law, a spirit, a custom”, this Europe of landscapes and folklore, this Europe which Erasme, of which was said to be the preceptor, said we should ask to each young person, already, to “travel the continent to learn other languages” and “to get rid of its wild nature”, this Europe, traveled by so many wars and conflict: what holds it, it’s culture.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>In unity his speech, Macron includes both solidarity and culture in unity. The solidarity measures are included in the end of the last chapter; they’re related to the convergence of each country’s social system. Here are the culture measures.</p><ul><li>Before 25, each student should have spent 6 months in another European country.</li><li>Each student will have to speak at least 2 European languages starting 2024.</li><li>Creation of European universities in which students will be able to study abroad and will follow courses in at least two languages. Those should be places for pedagogic innovation. 20 should be built before 2024, the firsts should come next year.</li><li>Harmonisation or common acknowledgment of each country’s high school diplomas.</li><li>The hymn of the Olympic Games in France in 2024 will be the Ode to Joy.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Democracy</h3><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“The founding fathers built Europe to the shelter of the people, because they were an enlightened vanguard, because maybe we could have done it, and they moved forward later proving that it works. […] This page has shattered on the European democratic doubts, those followed by the “nos” at the French and Dutch referendums. […] But we shouldn’t fall in the populists or the extremes’ trap consisting in saying “let’s ask the question directly in a simplistic way: yes or no?”. The answer is known, it’s always “no”, whatever the question is. We must redesign the European project, by and with the people, with a democratic requirement much stronger than a simple binary question.”</em></blockquote><p><em>﻿</em></p><p>The way Europe has been built created a distance between people and the builders. That prevented people from owning the European project. That gap must be filled and that can only be made by strengthening the European democratic system.

But the time when France proposes to move forward with Europe and with all Europeans who wish to do so, this time has come back, and I think now about Robert Schuman on the 9 May 1950, in Paris, daring to propose to build Europe. I think about his striking words when he said “Europe hasn’t been done and we had the war” […] So I‘m talking to all European leaders, whatever are your difficulties, whatever are the jolts, we only have one responsibility, the one to which our youth obliges us, the one for the generations to come, the one to earn their gratitude otherwise we deserve their contempt.

Therefore, on this blog, I try from time to time, or as often as it is possible, to help keep my readers informed about the independent designers from all over the world trying to leave their mark on the international fashion arena. This time I would like to introduce you to B Sides Handmade, a Polish knitwear brand with its roots in Podlasie region, very close to my heart as I was born there.</p><p><br></p><p>Basia Chrabolowska is a designer and owner of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.bsideshandmade.com/index.php' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>B Sides&nbsp;</a>established in 2011. The idea for this fashion undertaking was born based on a special bond between grand-mother and grand-daughter and their unique love for wool. The designer’s vision of the brand is based on quality, simplicity and functionality. She reinvents traditional hand-made craft according to the necessities of the modern times. All clothes and accessories are 100% made of alpaca and merino wool. The current collection, LA Americana FW1516 is inspired by the travels in South America.</p><p><br></p><p>When we look at the beautiful photos accompanying the campaign, we find references of the Argentinian cowboys “gauchos”, the Colombian region Cauca and vivid colors of the local folklore of Mexico and Peru. The line mostly consists of sweaters, skirts and dresses, precisely knitted by the knitwear artists in Podlasie region. The clothes are ultra feminine, minimalist and sensual. They can be worn directly on the naked skin, as merino wool has amazing qualities such as the ability to regulate the body temperature, providing warm without overheating the wearer; it is slightly moisture repellent and contains lanolin with anti-bacterial and hypoallergenic qualities and is one of the softest types of wool.</p><p><br></p><p>The pictures of the campaign of B Sides promote beauty of the Polish landscape mixed with influences of the cultures of South America. (The bracelets which are part of the collection were handmade by the local artisans in Colombia.) The entire collection was made in Poland. Fingers crossed for Basia and her super natural and tradition-curious approach to fashion!!! Please let me know who are your favorite local designers and why you think what they do is unique! Let’s try to support them through this holiday season!</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>B SIDES&nbsp;</span><a href='http://www.bsideshandmade.com/' target='_blank' style='color: inherit; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'>www.bsideshandmade.com</a></p><p><em style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>Originally published at&nbsp;</em><a href='http://www.stylecharmer.com/2015/12/b-sides-polish-fashion-brand-you-need.html' target='_blank' style='color: inherit; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><em>www.stylecharmer.com</em></a><em style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>.</em></p><p></p>",

summary: "Last Saturday, around 30,000 people marched through the streets of Dublin on the Sixth Annual March for Choice. I was one of many who carried posters, pinned badges to coats, and chanted “hey-ho, hey-ho, the Eighth Amendment has got to go” whilst bemused groups of tourists looked on.",
content: "<p></p><p>Last Saturday, around 30,000 people marched through the streets of Dublin on the Sixth Annual March for Choice. I was one of many who carried posters, pinned badges to coats, and chanted “<em>hey-ho, hey-ho, the Eighth Amendment has got to go</em>” whilst bemused groups of tourists looked on. It was a fun experience, and my first time at a political rally or march concerned with repealing the Eighth Amendment. People were jovial, energised and proud to be marching alongside sisters, mothers and female colleagues, united in the belief that women should no longer have to suffer under such an antiquated, Byzantine amendment to the Irish Constitution.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing that did concern me however was the proliferation of hard-left groups at the march.&nbsp;<em>People Before Profit</em>,&nbsp;<em>Solidarity</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Socialist Worker’s Party</em>&nbsp;were all there in large numbers, as were a lot of people sympathetic to hard-left politics but maybe not attached to any one specific political party. You may think it strange that I was concerned by the appearance of such groups, especially at a march concerned with supporting a woman’s right to choose. For those of you familiar with marches that focus on social causes, it shouldn’t be a surprise to hear or see such groups at such marches — You can usually bank on them being there in fact; a march wouldn’t be complete with a communist group of one kind or another belting on about how corrupt the state is and how the workers should rise up.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason for my concern is how their appearance affects how the whole Repeal movement is seen. Now, I’m&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;saying they can’t march with us, no sir. They have every right to take advantage of that freedom. But my concern arises from the fact that their appearance — the appearance of any so-called ‘revolutionary’ group in fact — at the march could potentially hamper attempts to win over more moderate, less politically-inclined Irish men and women who are undecided in regards to whether we should repeal the Eighth Amendment, and allow free, safe and legal abortion for women to be available on this island.</p><p><br></p><p>Perception in politics is, sadly, still everything. The perception of those who want to repeal the Eighth as Trotskyite revolutionaries is one that the movement should shake if it wants to win the hearts and minds of so-called ‘middle Ireland’. Signs such as that which was tied to O’Connell Bridge, reading “<em>early risers smash the State</em>” (a reference to comments by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar), and stunts such as one by Trinity College Dublin’s&nbsp;<em>People Before Profit</em>&nbsp;branch — whereby they pulled down signs advertising a pro-life event — are incredibly unhelpful, and do not represent the vast majority of those who march for a woman’s right to choose. The latter in particular irked me the most, as the group posted (then deleted) photos of them taking down such signs as if it was some heroic act, even though it was frankly incredibly childish and an act that violated the pro-life lobby’s right to free expression.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m a proud pro-choice advocate, but I’m also somebody who is pro-market, pro-free trade and pro-EU. The hard-left are none of those things, and yet it feels as if they have a monopoly on the pro-choice ‘brand’ and its message. Not only does this turn off more moderate, less politically active voices, it also really hinders the movement when it comes to winning over undecided voices before the referendum on the Eighth next year. I’ve friends in that undecided camp, many of them women, who feel intimidated by the attitude of “<em>repeal the Eighth, no debate</em>” that currently exist within the pro-choice movement — The appearance of that movement as a revolutionary, destructive force only further intimidates them and makes them feel that (a) the movement isn’t open to them, and (b) unsure as to whether to vote to repeal the Eighth at all.</p><p><br></p><p>This piece is a call to those like me, moderates for choice. For Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Labour and Green Party voters who are pro-choice. This movement needs you to speak up and speak louder than the voices of the revolutionary far-left. We need to make it clear that not all that want repeal are revolutionaries — We’re just ordinary, at times politically ambivalent individuals who just want to support women in Ireland by giving them a choice when it comes to abortion.</p><p></p>",

Of course you have to have some rituals. What you need are&nbsp;VISA, mobile phone number and address.</p><p><br></p><p>Some says that you can open an account at N26 even if you are not a resident of the country, but things has changed. Because of refugees and terror attack all over Europe, money laundering law was tightened in Spring 2017, it became more strict to open an account or to have mobile phone number. So you have to have resident permission in somewhere in Europe.</p><p><br></p><h3>Freelance VISA in Berlin&nbsp;2017</h3><p>I’m going to explain about actual VISA issuing situation in Berlin, because I’m in Germany and don’t know much about other countries related to VISA.</p><p>It became also a bit harder but still it’s possible to get VISA as a freelancer in Berlin.</p><p>From 2017 you have to have or will have at least 2 clients in Germany to apply for VISA. It could be your future customer if you have contract or endorsement to prove it. So better to have contacts in advance.</p><p><br></p><h3>Which bank?</h3><p>There are new startups and everything is changing quickly. At this time in October 2017, I would recommend following smart banks.</p><p><br></p><h3>N2<span style='color: inherit;'>6 bank</span></h3><p><span style='color: inherit;'>N</span><a href='https://n26.go2cloud.org/SH7G' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>26</a>&nbsp;is a German startup bank in Berlin, but you can open an account if you are a resident of following 17 European countries.</p><p><em>Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain</em></p><p>・free German account with your own real IBAN</p><p>・free MasterCard</p><p>・smartphone based service</p><p>・open an account in 8 minutes (they say and it’s true)</p><p><a href='https://n26.go2cloud.org/SH7G' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>N26</a>&nbsp;is basically free but it costs sometimes. For example: withdrawal in foreign currency — 1.7%.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Revolut</h3><p><a href='http://revolut.com/' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>Revolut</a>&nbsp;is a London startup smart-bank. You can have UK account.</p><p>・free UK account</p><p>・multi currency account</p><p>・free MasterCard(virtual &amp; physical)</p><p>・quick to open account(in an hour)</p><p><br></p><p>In July 2017 they raised $66 million and going to expand their services and preparing to come to Germany, so don’t worry about after Brexit.</p><p><br></p><h3>TransferWise</h3><p><a href='https://transferwise.evyy.net/c/470655/26105/985?subId1=medium' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>TransferWise</a>&nbsp;is one of the cheapest way of international money transfer.

You can get your own IBAN and send/receive money but it’s not really your own and kind of subaccount of TransferWise. As a result, in account holder name you have to add 2 letters of “TW” for Euro account. But you can have UK account for GBP, US account for USD. It means your client doesn’t have to make international transfer!</p><p><br></p><h3>Invoice App: Zervant and Smallinvoice</h3><p>Here I introduce you 2 free invoicing app.</p><p><br></p><h3>Zervant</h3><p><a href='https://www.smallinvoice.de/DE/en/' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>Smallinvoice</a></p><p>Both apps have following:</p><p>・free</p><p>・cloud software</p><p>・supporting all currencies</p><p>・create estimate and invoice</p><p>・statistics &amp; reports</p><p>・check overdue</p><p><br></p><p><a href='http://zervant.com/' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>Zervant</a>&nbsp;is a Finnish start up based in London. It’s completely free though not yet perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m using this software as a resident in Germany, but it doesn’t show German legal terminology. You have to add footnote if it is needed to be accepted by tax office. I haven’t check another country.</p><p>They raised $4 million and I hope it’s going to be developed further.</p><p><br></p><p>This software is designed for optimal use in Germany, whether VAT rates or terminology. So if you are freelance in Germany, it’s better to use this one.</p><p><br></p><p>Although smallinvoice has more functions and I’m in Germany, I use not smallinvoice but Zervant. Because it’s more simple and has beautiful interface DESIGN. It makes more fun for me and my staffs to work with Zervant. If they both have same design, I would use smallinvoice. Yes, design is very important factor, I noticed.</p><p></p>",

You can suggest any type of drug by commenting in the comment section below the videos or by using the hashtag #drugslab. Besides our weekly experiment, we provide you of safe methods of use, safe doses, the effects, the risks and very useful do’s and don’ts when high on drugs. Given by experienced epicureans.

That’s why it’s supported by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.</p><p>In Europe, the Netherlands are known to be relaxed toward recreational drugs. But relaxed doesn’t necessarily mean uneffective. As the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction put it:</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“Dutch drugs policy aims to discourage and reduce drug use, as far as it causes damage to health and to society, and to prevent and reduce the damage associated with drug use, drug production and the drugs&nbsp;trade.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>This, of course, echoes the global debate about drugs interdiction. The interdiction aims to protect people against both health issues and addiction that drugs can beget. However, it’s still unclear if a straight interdiction is the best option, as the blackmarket substitutes can be dangerous and people remain unprepared when they end up consuming anyway. Moreover, as we can understand in a famous TED talk given by Johann Hari at TEDGlobalLondon in 2015, the drug itself may not be the one responsible for addiction, but loneliness and isolation are.</p><p><br></p><p>But the charts from the ECDDA show the Netherlands are good but not the best in their actions against drugs issues (<a href='http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/4512/TD0616155ENN.pdf' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>see the full study here</a>):</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>",

While much of the analysis on her speech has focused on a supposed “softening” of May’s stance on Brexit, I believe that the most important takeaway from the speech is the clarification of the mindset of the UK government going into the next round of negotiations.</p><p><br></p><p>In her Florence speech, May explained in (no uncertain terms) that the UK does not see Brexit as some means to an end to spite the EU. Instead, it is an opportunity for each party to move seek their future along different paths. It is no secret that the UK had always maintained a fundamentally different view of the purpose of the EU compared to the Eurozone leaders (i.e. Germany and France). The UK has always seen the EU as a, primarily, economic project. Meanwhile, the Eurozone leaders see the EU as something bigger, along the lines of economic, political, and social supranational actor. While the idea of a “United States of Europe” isn’t as prominent anymore, it certainly hasn’t died out in these circles. As the recent history of the EU has shown, these heterogenous views have lead to tensions and outright infighting within the EU. Therefore, Brexit should be seen as an opportunity for each party to move forward as partners that accept each other’s differences, rather than continue to exist as countries constantly fighting one another (within the EU).</p><p><br></p><p>On a side note, it is worrying that many EU leaders (and the Remain-leaning media) are still perpetuating the misconception that the UK wants to spite the EU. The hardened Leavers with this view do not make up the majority of Leave voters, nor do they in any way represent the government. Therefore, it is up to the EU to stop fighting these proxy ideological battles with May in an attempt to “show” how wrong those Leavers are.</p><p><br></p><p>May also made a very important clarification about the nature of the future relationship between the EU and the UK. May correctly noted that Brexit cannot be compared to Norway or Canada, as every EU regulation and law is contained in the UK. This means that negotiations are beginning from a fundamentally equal starting point. It is tiring to see the EU and media hung up on these previous examples as if there isn’t any way forward for a groundbreaking agreement. Before the European Economic Community existed, there wasn’t anything like it. Before the Maastricht Treaty was signed, there was nothing like it either. The stubbornness of the EU to create a unique relationship, therefore, points to a determination to stymie the UK. This is, most likely, related to the previously noted misperception that the UK wants to harm the EU.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the day, the most important takeaway form May’s speech is that there is a fundamental misunderstanding between the perception of the Brexit negotiation between the UK and the EU. The EU, unfortunately, seems to be more interested in virtue signaling and fighting ideological battles with a small minority of Leave voters. The campaign for Brexit is over, and it’s time for the grown ups to put the bad blood away. May has put forward her hand in friendship, and it’s now time for the EU to step up and move forward in a positive manner with Brexit.</p><p></p>",

Once we begin appreciating better quality, the need for novelty wears off.” It’s the end of the Sustainable Fashion event in Athens, and I’ve contacted Stamos Fafalios to find out how Greek designers are coping during the country’s current period of austerity. </p><p><br></p><p>Fafalios is director of Atopos cvc, an Athenian organisation that specialises in archiving and curating strange or unusual pieces, with an emphasis on exploring the relationship between fashion and the human form throughout the ages. As such, sustainability has come to play a central role in their thinking, and it’s an idea that is also fast infiltrating the creative mindset of designers in Greece. </p><p><br></p><p>The new approach is surprising, because the numbers for Greece’s economy aren’t good. Sustainable manufacturing typically demands funding and finance, and in spite of minor growth in the latter part of 2016, the unemployment rate in the country is at 23% (the highest in Europe); the national debt stands at €320 billion (around £271 billion); consumption and exports have fallen by 6.4% and 7.2% in the second quarter of 2016; and since 2009, the poorest 20% of Greece’s 11 million inhabitants have experienced a reduction in their disposable income of 42%. It’s hardly an optimistic scenario. Businesses in Greece typically need fast cash, and slow, local fashion has historically not delivered substantial or immediate revenue. Yet in the face of entropy, a sustainable approach to fashion in Greece is offering an interesting and adaptable economic model that could set an agenda for long-term economic recovery. </p><p><br></p><p>Fashion was one of the first industries to suffer when the crisis began in 2009. In 2011, production of clothing had dropped by 25.8% as consumers stopped buying, and the retail industry rapidly shrank. In 2017, the situation looks similarly fragile; in particular the widening gulf between prices charged by brands and low consumer discretionary spending. This is unsurprising in light of the 2016 austerity measures, which included an increase in VAT to 24% (making this the sixth VAT revision since 2010, where it was originally 19%). Money for nonessential items is scarce. </p><p><br></p><p>In retail and fashion design, the burden has fallen on small businesses that struggled to adapt to changing circumstance. Unlike major global conglomerates such as Zara and H&amp;M, small retailers do not have the international reach to swallow losses and sustain their operations during difficult times. Similarly, while H&amp;M has invested in its online offer in Greece, independent stores that lack a digital presence or savvy marketing departments find themselves at a nearly insurmountable disadvantage. </p><p><br></p><p>Externally, the fashion industry (along with the rest of the industries in Greece) is also struggling to show that the country is open for business. While domestic policies currently pursued by the government are not favourable to external trade, the media also performs a negative role by presenting a necessary yet singular narrative of instability and decline — unhelpful when trying to attract foreign business. Tonia Fouseki, CEO of Athens Xclusive Designers Week, says via email, ‘Currently there has been a worldwide ‘bombarding’ by the international media regarding the intense Greek crisis and economic issues. As a result, the effects on the national fashion industry have been dire, driving several designers to lower down their activity. </p><p><br></p><p>Slow shifts in this sphere are beginning to unfold. One of Germany’s biggest contemporary art fairs, Documenta 14, will also take place in Athens for the first time this year with the title ‘Learning from Athens’. The move is a welcome recognition of the capital’s creative potential — and one that could shape a new Greek narrative in the foreign press. ‘Greece is a traumatised area,’ explains Yorgos Tzirtzilakis, a consultant at the DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art. ‘The issue now is how to utilise this sudden interest in the country so that we offer something new and not just rely on this notion of trauma. That is the real challenge.’ Indeed, the sudden interest could just as quickly fade, creating an ‘Olympic Effect’ — that is, a sudden economic depression after an artificial stimulus — with long-term consequences more damaging than any short-term positive effects. </p><p><br></p><p>Yet within this fragile nexus of designers, retailers and customers, change and innovation are happening. Greek fashion is beginning to pivot towards a more local, sustainable model that could revolutionise the way in which businesses progress as austerity continues. ‘The current economic climate in Greece has encouraged a new, young, and creative talent to emerge, not just in fashion but also in other disciplines, Stamos Fafalios explains later on in our exchange. ‘Less greed, more sustainability, more ecological awareness, and much better working conditions mean that ‘fashion’ might begin doing itself a service. </p><p><br></p><p>Whether or not fashion has the ability to self-soothe will come down to the capacity of designers, retailers, customers and fashion executives to adopt a sustainable model across multiple platforms and parts of the industry, via a two-pronged approach. First a system that takes greater social — and environmental — responsibility for the impact it has on itself must be introduced: to pay workers fairly, to provide healthy working conditions, and to recycle and source materials that don’t pollute the environment. The second is economic sustainability: to create a system which uses a sustainable mindset to feed financial resources back into the economy, thereby engendering economic growth amongst local communities in Greece. </p><p><br></p><p>In many ways, it’s already happening. At Athens Xclusive Designers Week (AXDW), which takes place from the end of March to the beginning of April after the ‘star’ shows (New York, London, Milan, Paris), over 25,000 visitors descend on central Athens to witness the latest in domestic talent — and also to raise money for charity. Now in its 11th year, AXDW fosters the idea of ‘fashion with a conscience’, and money raised through the combination of catwalk shows, talks, and events has been donated to charities such as Make-A-Wish Foundation, Women in Need, and the Pink Ribbon Foundation. </p><p><br></p><p>While AXDW represents fashion as a service in a charitable form, the event also showcases the latest in Greek fashion design and highlights new ways designers are thinking. Tonia Fouseki tells me that the economic crisis ‘has led Greek designers to re-evaluate the way they work and to make greater efforts to penetrate not only Greek but also the international fashion markets.’ She adds, ‘Designers and successful brands are seeking creative and inspirational methods, managing on several occasions to even create an international reputation by creations that capitalise on traditional Greek aesthetics and history, as well as local fabrics and textiles like silk, rich colours, and even traditional methods of garment production. </p><p><br></p><p>Where designers have identified demand for ancient techniques and traditional aesthetics, businesses are thriving. Greece’s notable designer exports include Mary Katrantzou, Ancient Greek Sandals, Angelos Bratis, Zeus + Dione, and Sophia Kokosalaki, all of whom draw aesthetic and design inspiration from their heritage. ‘It was evident to me that connecting the sandals to ancient Greece would be a great idea,’ says Nikolas Minoglou, co-founder of Ancient Greek Sandals. ‘It’s in the brand’s DNA to use the traditional techniques of sandal-making that have existed for centuries in Greece,’ adds Christina Martini, the other co-founder of the brand. Now sold around the world, the success of Ancient Greek Sandals highlights the effectiveness of marrying local skills with international audiences. </p><p><br></p><p>Zeus + Dione, a relatively new brand borne out of the economic crisis, is another example. ‘Every day another shop would close, there would be stories of frustrated people in the papers, of jobs being lost,’ says co-founder Mareva Grabowski of the brand’s origins. ‘It was the end of the world as we knew it.’ Instead of despairing, the pair looked to traditional techniques as a means of reviving the Made in Greece ethos. Today they work with artisans from across the country: silk is crafted for the brand in Soufli, shirts are embroidered in Argos and Metsovo, and dresses are knitted in the Cyclades and Attica. ‘We could have turned to foreign manufacturers,’ adds fellow founder Dimitra Kolotoura. ‘It would have been easier and cheaper to produce our products in other countries, but that was not what we wished for. We wanted to create jobs in Greece, and at the same time, promote the traditional know-how of artisans. </p><p><br></p><p>Greek consumers’ desire for clothing value can be seen in the fact that jeans, children’s clothes, and sportswear have, according to reports from Euromonitor, been the most resilient in terms of sales recently. The volume of denim production actually rose by 4% in 2016. While Greek shoppers may look to make an impulse ‘fashion’ purchase from a cheap high-street store, they also want clothes that will deliver longevity and versatility. ‘[Greek consumers] have become more selective and conscious of ‘brand equity’,’ Tonia Fouseki notes. As such, the new generation of designers can use locally-made designs to speak to consumers in the domestic market — those who are willing to invest in quality, but still want value. And that’s a rare combination among fast-fashion brands. </p><p><br></p><p>Local production also enables Greek brands to offer an authenticity edge over its competitors — a brand advantage among young consumers who value sincerity as much as quality. </p><p><br></p><p>This combination of a local, sustainable model coupled with a nimble way of distributing narrative means that Greek fashion is poised to rejuvenate a flagging industry — Zeus + Dione are already growing 100%–110% year on year, according to the Guardian — and emerge as a model for others to follow. </p><p><br></p><p>In the Greek food industry, for example, this would involve adopting an approach that prioritises using local produce in restaurants, a mindset that has already been adopted by chefs such as Alexandros Kardasis of Athiri, a Michelin-starred restaurant that mixes traditional Greek cuisine with an innovative approach to local ingredients. The menu boasts only local Greek wines, the extra-virgin olive oil comes from ancient Olympia in the Peloponnese, and their suckling pig arrives directly from Aggelopoulos Farm in Koropi. Other businesses have started even earlier in the production chain; Radiki encourages restaurants to buy locally and experiment with new seasonal greens. ‘Every human action must have the most minimum ecological impact possible,’ says Radiki in their company manifesto, insisting that timely consumption must be the highest priority. </p><p><br></p><p>Thus the Greek fashion industry finds itself in an exciting position, at a time when expectations were wholly to the contrary. ‘Our stoic philosophers used to say “ouden kako amiges kale”,’ Fouseki muses, ‘or, “everything bad might always bring something good in the end.”</p><p></p>",

But their political situation today isn’t that different from other European countries.

  content: "<p></p><p>It’s hard to get back in autumn. Vacations are gone and the small diseases come back again followed by stress and depression. The guilty party: coolness and its procession, runny nose, headaches, neck pains, sciatic, backache. In short, we’re more inclined to spend the weekend in bed than going out and chase mushrooms.</p><p>Never again. Here are some advices to keep you safe and sound from coldness and rain. You must prepare yourself in autumn for winter to prevent cultivating the first virus coming.</p><p><br></p><h3>Rule 1. Never eat in the&nbsp;cold.</h3><p>To be in shape, you have to eat without exhausting. Digestion requires a lot of energy. Unfortunately, coolness slows it down, getting it more tiring and less efficient.</p><p>Indeed, on the one hand it’s tiring because the process is longer, not all the food is going to be assimilated, and you’ll have to eliminate more wastes. On the other hand, it’s less efficient because you won’t succeed to draw all the good vitamines, trace elements, calcium and others wich you bought, cooked, and swallowed.</p><p>To be efficient, you need to eat in a warm place and avoid eating an ice-cream or a cold dessert from the fridge by the end of your meal. The best would be to end it with a hot drink. Also, it’s good to have a warm soup as an appetizer because it preheats digestion.</p><p>Moreover, because preventing coolness is not always easy, make sure to chew your food a lot to facilitate your digestion.</p><p><br></p><h3>Rule 2. Strengthen your&nbsp;body.</h3><p>Every morning of the cold months or until you feel in harmony with coolness, have an infusion containing:</p><ul><li>Green tea (Sencha for example)</li><li>1 teaspoon of grated ginger root.</li></ul><p>Then, according to your tastes, add:</p><ul><li>1 teaspoon of rosemary or 1 teaspoon of thym or 1 teaspoon of origano or 3 cloves.</li></ul><p>Let it infuse in a cup of very hot water for 10 minutes, filter, and drink.</p><p><br></p><h3>Rule 3. Avoid muscular&nbsp;pains.</h3><p>From the firsts tensions or aches, make massages with sesame oil.</p><p><br></p><h3>Rule 4. Use those essential oils.</h3><p>Beware of contraindications and administration. Essential oils are very active products and can be dangerous. Don’t hesitate to ask for advices from your doctor or the pharmacist.</p><ul><li>Against viruses (sinusitis, rhinitis, gastroenteritis), in prevention or in cure: put one drop of Niaouli on your skin in the interior face of each wrist. Mornings and nights, or just nights. It boosts immune defenses and control viruses. Do not take it if you’re pregnant and during breastfeeding, if you’re a child under 3, if you’re epileptic, if your asthmatic or if you have allergies to limonene and linalool.</li><li>Against muscular pains (elongation, stiff neck, aches, sciatica, tendonitis, arthritis, rheumatism): use a drop of Eucalyptus lemon or of Pepper mint diluted in a teaspoon of sesame oil. Massage two to three times a day. Contraindications during the three firsts months of pregnancy.</li><li>You can also use Pepper mint diluted in sesame oil for a massage against sciatica, tendonitis, rheumatism. Pepper mint can also be used pure, as a drop on a bruise. Finally, it’s also effective against headaches with a teaspoon of honey. Do not take it if you’re pregnant and during breastfeeding, if you’re a child under 7, if you’re epileptic, if your asthmatic or if you have allergies to one of the oil component.</li><li>Against tiredness and insomnia, have a massage with sesame oil and a drop of Ylang-ylang. Otherwise, put some drops of it in your bath, or just one in a diffuser. Contraindications are the same as pepper mint.</li><li>Against spider bites, after cleaning and drying the wound, put one drop of Lavender aspic. Renew it regularly.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>You’re now ready for winter! You can dig deeper and find all these informations in several books (unfortunately in French…):</p><ul><li>Médecine tibéraine et alimentation. Dr Namgyal Qusar, Jean-Claude Sergent. Ed. Calmann-Lévy.</li><li>Le charme discret de l’intestin&nbsp;.Giulia Enders. Ed. ACTE SUD.</li></ul><p><br></p><p></p>",

My friend&nbsp;<a href='https://twitter.com/bartekchlebek' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>@bartekchlebek</a>&nbsp;told me about the place. He and his girlfriend stumbled upon it while urban hiking. He invited me for a similar hike and was excited to go there again. When we finally went I understood why. What is really fascinating about this place that is that almost each garage door is painted in a different color.</p><p><br></p><p>Each owner chose the color he liked. There was clearly no collective effort to keep any visual consistency. It’s rather a beauty contest.</p><p>It’s also super clear which garages are used and which are not. Some of them are neat, others clearly neglected.</p><p>I didn’t do any extensive research of the history of this place, but found out that it is somehow connected to&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Babice_Airport' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>Babice Airport</a>&nbsp;that lays nearby and has it’s military past.</p><p><br></p><h3>Photoshoot</h3><p>I became inspired by the rich palette of these otherwise identical objects. I was struck by the idea to photograph each of the garage door and use them as large pixels. The idea was to write a computer program that will sort the colors and produce transition.</p><p><br></p><p>I visited the place 3 times during a weekend to take photos. Not that it took so much time. I just didn't’ want any harsh shadows on the garage doors, so went there in different times of the day to compare the lighting. I also went to shoot some closeups and details.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end I photographed 135 garages, which is not even a half of what’s there. I didn’t want to use garages with wooden doors. Also some metal door garages are positioned in a way that always produces harsh shadows.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Anyways… the easy part was over. Now was the time to write a program.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way… I’m not a software developer. I decided to learn Action Script 3 and gained some proficiency literally moments before the technology died. I still use Flash to build some tools for my personal projects.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sorting colors</h3><p>I put my photos aside and started figuring out color sorting. I didn’t realise the complexity of the problem. I found a&nbsp;<a href='http://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/09/30/colour-sorting/' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>great article</a>&nbsp;about it by Alan Zucconi. I did not analyse the Python examples, but the article gave me a good theoretical base to start with my own experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same moment I realised that ages ago I’ve researched the way Magic Wand in photoshop works and shared it on the user group. I knew I could use that knowledge to produce my algorithm for sorting.</p><p><br></p><p>What Magic wand does is select the area of pixels which colors are similar to a sampled pixel. The similarity of selected colors is described by a Tolerance property.</p><p><br></p><p>I googled for my post describing the maths behind that tool and found it. It was posted in May 2005.</p><p>I learned that the difference in color value is measured for each channel.</p><p><br></p><pre spellcheck='false'>var dR:int = r0 - r1
var dG:int = g0 - g1
var dB:int = b0 - b1
</pre><p><br></p><p>Magic Wand then sums abstract values of the smallest and the greatest of the differences. The value is then compared against a number set as Tolerance. If it’s smaller the color is similar enough to be selected.</p><p><br></p><p>That was great. I could compare two colors and describe their similarity by a single number. The smaller the number the more similar are the colors.</p><p><br></p><pre spellcheck='false'>var similarity:int = Math.abs(Math.Min([dR,dG,dB])) + Math.abs(Math.Max([dR,dG,dB]))
</pre><p><br></p><p>So I used that equation to build a sorting method. It moves colors, one by one from source array to destination array by their similarity. It always focuses on the last color in the destination array to search for the most similar in the source array. I guess it’s a nearest neighbour algorithm?</p><p><br></p><p>Anyway. I was super happy with the results it produced.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing that I haven’t thought about is that for a given array of colors my method will produce different results depending on the color it starts with.</p><p><br></p><p>At first I wanted to fix that problem and spent some time modifying the algorithm to always produce the same order. It worked, but I wasn’t happy with the result. I got back to refining the method, but then it hit me:</p><p><br></p><p>Why am I trying to end up with just one image when I can have 135 unique images?</p><p><br></p><p>I stopped. The sorting method was done.</p><p><br></p><h3>What color is the garage&nbsp;door?</h3><p>Next step was to extract the color from the photographs. I mean. I needed only one HEX value for each photograph.</p><p><br></p><p>After examining each file I decided to sample two pixels in the middle of each door wing. But before sampling the color value I applied a BlurFilter method to average the color value in a sampled area. As a final color I used the average of two samples.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>I spent all day manually cropping and adjusting the geometry of the photos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>Once they were prepared I ran my script that extracted the colors and created an array of objects referencing the BitmapData as well as R,G,B,H,S,V and HEX values associated with it.</span></p><p><br></p><h3>Final images</h3><p>So, I had a method for extracting colors, I had a sorting algorithm. It was time to put them to work and produce the final images. I used&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/LeeBurrows/Async-Image-Encoders' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>Lee Burrows’s asynchronous png encoder</a>. It saved my life as the standard encoder was unable to process such a huge bitmap.</p><p><br></p><p>So I just sat there and watched the pictures landing on my hard drive as the script was working.</p><p>Even though I was creatively and emotionally involved in every aspect of this stupid project I felt strangely amazed. I became the first consumer of my own art. Like I just stumbled upon a gallery and walked in expecting nothing.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84);'>I love them all. I decided to print the number 57.</span></p><p><br></p><p>That’s all I wanted to say about Himalajska street. For now. I do plan to shoot more and create another batch with 200+ and 300+ photos.</p><p><br></p><p>If either of you two people who’ve read it to the end have a question feel free to leave a comment (or ping me on twitter I guess)</p><p></p>",
